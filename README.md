# 210 Personal Project - Freeze Runner

## Description

This will be a 2D platformer game which the hero
has a superpower: chronostasis, the power to ***freeze the time***. There's no story in the game because
one, I don't have the time (due to MATH 101), and two, not every game has to have a story

Unlike most main characters, their power is so weak that they can only stop time for 3 seconds.
The player needs to use their new found superpower and intelligence to get pass the boss's
traps and soldiers, and eventually beat the boss.
