# 210 Personal Project - Freeze Runner

## Description

This will be a 2D platformer game where the protagonist (played by the player)
needs to beat the boss and save their friend. Like most main characters, the protagonist
has a superpower: chronostasis, the power to ***freeze the time***.

Unlike most main characters, their power is so weak that they can only stop time for 3 seconds.
The player needs to use their new found superpower and intelligence to get pass the boss's
traps and soldiers, and eventually beat the boss.
